    //Debouncing is a technique used in JavaScript to control the rate at which particular function or event handler is executed. It helps in optimizing performance and reducing the number of times a function is called, especially when dealing with events like resizing the window, scrolling, or typing in an input field. 

    The main idea behind debouncing is to wait for a certain amount of time after the last event occurrence an dhten execute the associated function. This can be helpful in scenarios where events may fire rapidly and repeatedly ( such as keypress events) but you want to handle them only once afte a pause. 
    
    <script>
        function debounce(func, delay) {
            let timer;

            return function () {
                const context = this;
                // console.log(context)
                const args = arguments;
                // console.log(args)
                // console.log(args)

                clearTimeout(timer);
                timer = setTimeout(function () {
                    func.apply(context, args);
                }, delay);
            };
        }
        const debouncedFunction = debounce(function () {
            // console.log("Function executed after a delay.");
        }, 200); // Delay of 200 milliseconds

        // Attach the debounced function to an event
        window.addEventListener("resize", debouncedFunction);
    </script>
