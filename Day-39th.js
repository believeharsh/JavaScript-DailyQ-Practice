// JavaScript / ECMAScript
// JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

// It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

// After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).

// Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).

// The ECMA Technical Committee 39
// In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization, and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language.

// ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997.

// From ES4 to ES6
// When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into 2 very different camps:

// The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp:
// Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.

// The ECMAScript 4 Camp:
// Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade.

// August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an email:

// It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.

// The solution was to work together:

// ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5
// ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3.
// Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions.
// TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5.
// The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed "Harmony" (Because of the split it created?).

// ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were fully compliant by July 2013:
