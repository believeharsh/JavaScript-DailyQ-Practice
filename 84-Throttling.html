     <!-- Throttling or sometimes also called throttle function is a practice used in websites. Throttling is used to call a function after every millisecond or a particular interval of time only the first click is executed immediately.
     Letâ€™s see, what will happen if the throttle function is not present on the web page. Then the number of times a button is clicked the function will be called the same number of times. -->
