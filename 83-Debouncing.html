    <!-- Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the performance of the web page. In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.
    Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser performance. There might be some functionality in a web page that requires time-consuming computations. If such a method is invoked frequently, it might greatly affect the performance of the browser, as JavaScript is a single-threaded language.  -->
